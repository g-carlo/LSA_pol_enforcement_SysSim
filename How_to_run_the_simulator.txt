- The simulator requires MatLab Parallel toolbox to run.
- This simulator requires Matlab.


                          TO START

1) SET the paramters:

Before running the simulation, you need to set some parameters, namely

- misbehaviour probabilities for the Licensee Operators in "mbeh_probs"
Only set the first two values and leave the third fixed to 0.
- number of simulation snapshots in "n_sim".
- penalty thresholds in "penaltyThreshold". As many values as you require for your simulations.
The more values, the more simulations the simulator will run (n_sim per penalty threshold value)
- result file label in "saveFileLabel". The simulator will save the results in a .mat file with
the the label you set.

2) RUN the SIMULATOR

To run the simulator, run function "runMultipleSiulations.m"

3) SAVED RESULTS

The results will be saved in the folder where you store the simulator files, with the label
you set in the parameters.
